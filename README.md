## A fast graphical user interface for the [dyClamp](https://github.com/christianrickert/dyClamp) sketch


[pyClamp](https://github.com/christianrickert/pyClamp) is a feature-complete graphical user interface written in Python demonstrating the flexibility of the novel dynamic clamp implementation. 

[dyClamp](https://github.com/christianrickert/dyClamp) is a reimplementation of [dynamic_clamp](https://github.com/nsdesai/dynamic_clamp) with a focus on a robust serial communication between the Teensy and its controlling host computer.
